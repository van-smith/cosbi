microprocessors dominates the fastest Intel (nasdaq: INTC) Pentium 4s, yet cost 
much less money.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Today, both Intel and AMD 
launch yet more salvos at each other as the rival chipmakers announce new chips.&nbsp; 
Intel debuts a new Pentium 4 codenamed “Northwood.”&nbsp; Based on a young 
0.13-micron process, Northwood features a 512kB level 2 cache, which doubles the 
older Willamette Pentium 4’s complement.&nbsp; Aside from this one enhancement, 
Northwood is otherwise functionally identical.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rival AMD cranks up the 
clock speed with the release of its Athlon XP 2000+.&nbsp; Running at 1667MHz, the 
new AMD chip is a simple bump forwards for the successful XP core.</span></p>

originally scheduled to pit the new Athlon XP 2000+ against Intel’s 2.2GHz 
Northwood.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Intel was unable to supply us with the necessary chip in

to the widely reported production problems the chipmaker has been having nor to 
alleged Northwood shortages.&nbsp;</span></p>

===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Quantispeed Versus Netburst</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The contrast of Athlon XP 
against Pentium 4 is one of efficiency versus clock speed.&nbsp; Even the Pentium 4’s 
strongest proponents have to yield to claims that the Athlon XP will 
significantly outperform similarly clocked Pentium 4s.&nbsp; AMD pundits have to bow 
to the greater clockspeeds of Intel chips.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Of course, what really 
matters is real world performance.&nbsp; The Pentium 4 embodies the school of thought 
claiming that higher clock speed is a panacea for wringing more performance out 
of a given fabrication process technology.&nbsp; The key to reaching higher clock 
speeds is extending a processor’s “pipeline.”&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Deeper Pipeline = Higher 
Clock Speeds * Lower Efficiencies</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Imagine a “sandwich CPU” 
which has instructions to make ham sandwiches, BLTs, etc.&nbsp; To accomplish an 
instruction in one clock tick, a large number of steps would have to be 
hardwired so that the chip can start from nothing and end up with sandwich in a 
single clock cycle.&nbsp; Visualize a number of dedicated robotic arms, one handling 
bread, another delivering meat and so forth.&nbsp; These hands slam together a 
sandwich simultaneously in one Byzantine operation.&nbsp; Although this is 
complicated to implement, if you ask for a roast beef sandwich, you will get it 
one tick later.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Alternatively, the steps to 
making the sandwich could be broken out so that producing a sandwich takes, say, 20 ticks.&nbsp; 
At one step the bread is positioned, at the next, condiments are applied, then a 
slice of meat is added at the following station, etc.&nbsp; Now a 
sandwich won’t pop out immediately like in the first design, but implementing 
each step in assembly line fashion will be much easier to do.&nbsp; Because of this, 
the hypothetical sandwich CPU should be able to run faster because it doesn’t have to perform 
 
much work in each "tick" or step.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, we can make 
each step in the assembly line flexible enough to perform analogous work on any 
sandwich requested.&nbsp; Set up this way, after the first sandwich pops out 20 
cycles after it is requested, subsequent sandwiches will roll off the line every 
clock tick.&nbsp; So after the initial delay, or latency, this sandwich processor is 
as fast as the original processor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Because the second 
processor cannot know what the orders will be 20 steps beforehand, it guesses 
them to keep this assembly line, or “pipeline,” fed.&nbsp; Modern processors are 
pretty good at making these kinds of guesses.&nbsp; However, a twenty cycle penalty will be exacted 
whenever our processor is wrong, or “mispredicts” a series of orders, and the 
pipeline needs to be restarted or “flushed.”&nbsp; As in real life, this happens 
often enough to worry about.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Pitted against our original 
processor, our pipelined processor will always be slower as long as it runs at 
the same speed, but hopefully the pipelining will allow our second chip to run 
faster.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Let’s now mercifully break 
from our sandwich processor analogy.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Athlon XP has a ten 
stage pipeline while the Pentium 4 has twenty pipeline stages.&nbsp; Largely because of its deeper 
pipeline, the P4 can reach higher clock speeds.&nbsp; However, missed predictions 
that cause pipeline “stalls” also cause a very significant twenty cycle delay in 
the Pentium 4 versus only a ten cycle delay in the Athlon XP.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Deeper Pipeline = Greater 
Complexity and Design Compromises</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What is worse for the 
Pentium 4 is that implementing all of its pipeline steps, or “stages,” requires 
a greater degree of design complexity making the chip big and power hungry.&nbsp; 
Both of these characteristics undermine attaining higher clock speeds, or “clock 
speed ramping.”&nbsp; Because the P4 grew so large, the number of functional units 
had to be reduced, which further handicaps it against the Athlon XP.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Higher Clock Speeds = More 
Thermal Issues</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another phenomena that 
becomes a growing concern in deeply pipelined designs like the Pentium 4 is 
localized overheating.&nbsp; Silicon is not a good conductor of heat and across 
a sprawling die one part of 
the CPU could be working furiously and getting hot while other regions of the 
chip might be  idle and cool.&nbsp; Because the P4 has to run at high clock 
speeds to remain competitive with designs like the Athlon XP,  an extreme 
temperature gradient might develop so that the part of chip could be destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intel has attempted to 
combat this severe problem primarily through two means.&nbsp; The first is called 
“clock gating,” where idle portions of the P4 are shut down; therefore, in many 
instances, this reduces the total amount of heat being generated.&nbsp; Although this can 
make the chip cooler overall, temperature gradients across the die can become even more 
extreme.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intel’s second measure was 
to implement the controversial Thermal Monitor.&nbsp; This mechanism utilizes a 
thermal sensor embedded in a region of the Pentium 4 die most susceptible to 
localized overheating.&nbsp; In other words, the probe is located in a “hot spot.”&nbsp; 
The problem is that there are several hot spots on the P4 die.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Thermal Issues Gate 
Performance </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unlike the Pentium III and 
mechanisms being rolled out with the Athlon XP, relying on a failsafe shutdown 
is dicey.&nbsp; By the time the Thermal Monitor registers a certain temperature, 
let's say 70 degrees Celsius, a 
distant hot spot could already be at dangerously high temperatures.&nbsp; On the 
other hand, perhaps merely 
the area immediately around the Thermal Monitor is 70, which is no reason for 
concern.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the Thermal 
Monitor cannot know which situation exists.&nbsp; What Intel has decided to do 
under this circumstance, is to immediately halt and restart the P4 in cycles of 
about 2 microseconds.&nbsp; This speed reduction is called “throttling.”&nbsp; A 
50% duty cycle is imposed by default, but this duty cycle can be overridden 
through software or chipset control so that it is issued in 12.5% increments 
until the chip cools down.&nbsp; If the chip continues to heat up, at a 
predefined point a legacy PIII-type mechanism will force the chip to shut down 
completely to avoid CPU burn-up.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Consequently the Pentium 4 
has the most elaborate thermal protection of any CPU, but there also exists the 
possibility that throttling will be encountered during normal processing.&nbsp; There 
have been several reports of such P4 behavior under heavy load.&nbsp; We 
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/articles/2001/july/010723_P4_Throttling/010723_P4_Throttling.htm">documented</a> 
our experience with one Pentium 4 that apparently throttled in Quake III after 
intensive testing. &nbsp;Because this phenomenon was isolated to a single chip, we 
concluded that the specific CPU was defective.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nevertheless, all Pentium 
4s have the capacity to throttle, and chips that throttle under load may serve 
to inhibit Intel’s yields at high clock speeds.&nbsp; The fact that Intel couples its 
Pentium 4s with truly radical cooling solutions whose retaining mechanisms apply 
so much force onto the chip that the most delicate part of the motherboard is 
visibly deformed, strongly suggests that the chipmaker is keenly concerned with 
P4 thermal issues.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Although moving to a 
smaller process demands lower voltages to be used, thereby allowing the chip to run cooler at 
any given speed, the heat that chip does produce becomes more difficult to 
dissipate.&nbsp; 100 Watts pumped through an electric blanket will yield a surface 
that is only slightly warmer than room temperature as the surrounding air is 
sufficient to carry away the heat, but forcing 100 Watts through a processor die 
will cause an immediate meltdown unless a good heatsink is applied.&nbsp; As the 
Northwood ramps to higher clock speeds, heat will almost certainly serve as a 
ceiling as it does with current Athlon XPs.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Voltage Transients Grow 
with Clock Speed</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Finally, another problem 
for roadrunner, deeply pipelined chips is voltage transients.&nbsp; As clock speed 
increases, voltage transients become larger.&nbsp; When moving to the smaller 
geometries of Northwood, voltages are reduced, but relative voltage transients 
become even more severe.&nbsp; Intel has tried to reduce this issue by moving to 
Socket 478 which has a smaller package and more ground and power pins than 
Socket 423.&nbsp; However, a faster clocked processor is more more likely to be stymied by 
signal noise than a chip running at a lower clock speed.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Fewer Pitfalls to AMD’s 
Approach </font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With the Athlon XP, AMD has 
a core that has more execution units than the P4 does and a pipeline that is only 
half as deep as Intel’s chip.&nbsp; Consequently, the Athlon XP does not need to 
reach high clock rates to produce equivalent performance levels.&nbsp; With a 
smaller, simpler, more efficient design the Athlon XP is not as susceptible to 
regionalized overheating, and while the Pentium 4 has by far the more 
sophisticated thermal regulation circuitry, arguably it needs it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, adopting Intel’s 
level of clock gating would likely help AMD’s chips attain higher speeds.&nbsp; More 
aggressive clock gating is likely included AMD’s future design. &nbsp;Interestingly, the 
Athlon XP’s much shallower pipeline does not appear to be the limiting factor to 
the chip’s clock speed ramping.&nbsp; Rather, heat is.&nbsp; Likewise, thermal issues will 
likely prevent the Northwood from reaching the full potential of its deep 
pipeline – unless voltage transients stop it first.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile, the Athlon XP, 
by virtue of running at lower clock speeds, will have an inherent immunity to 
voltage transients over the Pentium 4.&nbsp;</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Interest Wanes in 
Hyper-Pipelines</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After an initial frenzy of 
interest in Intel’s Pentium 4 design, it appears that some of those same CPU 
architects are beginning to recognize the shortcomings of so-called 
“hyper-pipelines.”&nbsp; Increased design complexity, greater die sizes, heightened 
power demands, greater susceptibility to thermal problems and the goblins of 
voltage transients all stand as significant barriers to wringing out enough 
clock cycles to make such dramatically deep pipelines worthwhile.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Thread Level Parallelism</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most modern microprocessors 
are able to exploit instruction level parallelism.&nbsp; What this means is that 
chips are able to execute non-dependent instructions at the same time to boost 
processing efficiency.&nbsp; Processing efficiency is commonly referred to as “instructions per clock cycle” or 
“IPC.”&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The circuitry facilitating 
such scheduling trickery is complex.&nbsp; Proponents of VLIW (Very Long Instruction 
Word), like Transmeta, have argued for dumping these mechanisms and letting 
intelligent compilers organize code into batches that can be executed 
simultaneously.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Unfortunately for this 
group of people, it is very difficult if not impossible to offload this work to 

compilers and maintain performance levels equivalent to the best modern 
superscalar, out-of-order designs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, there is another 
side to this coin.&nbsp; Although greater parallelism will certainly lead to more 
performance, returns are beginning to diminish while complexity escalates.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Hammer, the unspoken 
vision of AMD is to take its very good Athlon XP core, tweak it to run 64-bit 
code and improve processing efficiency, but to also keep it small and modular to 
enable eventual multiple-core-per-die processing.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Why do this?&nbsp; Because it 
allows the operating system to maximize processor usage by dispensing tasks at 
thread level to the different cores.&nbsp; In this way, it is like a compromise with 
the principles of VLIW in that software is effectively delegating parallel CPU 
resources.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Thoroughbred in Q1: AMD’s 
Die Size Advantage to Broaden</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One of the most onerous 
aspects of the Willamette Pentium 4 is its huge die.&nbsp; At 217 mm<sup>2</sup>, the 
Willamette</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is over twice as large as its predecessor, the Pentium III.&nbsp; In fact, 
Intel needs roughly three times as many wafers to produce equivalent numbers of 
Pentium 4s as it did to produce the prior generation of chips.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Clearly this poses massive 
logistical problems as the chipmaker transitions production to this newer 
product line since moving to the Willamette Pentium 4 means a sudden tripling 
demand for fabrication resources. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Northwood, developed on 
a finer 0.13-micron copper process, relieves some of this demand by “shrinking” 
the Pentium 4.&nbsp; Even with its larger 512kB level 2 cache and 13-million more 
transistors, the Northwood is a comparatively svelte 146mm<sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, the Northwood is 
still over 13% larger than the current Athlon XP.&nbsp; Worse still, AMD plans to 
begin shipping its own 0.13-micron chip, dubbed “Thoroughbred,” later this 
quarter.&nbsp; At only 80 mm<sup>2</sup>, the Thoroughbred actually increases AMD’s 
existing die size advantages over the Willamette</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The current Athlon XP, also 
called “Palomino,” is 59% as large as </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Willamette</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, while Thoroughbred 
will only be about 55% as large as Northwood.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In fact, the Thoroughbred’s 
die size is so small that it is beginning to approach a condition known as “pad 
limited.”&nbsp; When a chip is pad limited, its die size is determined by the number 
of pads needed to connect the chip to its pins.&nbsp; Therefore, a pad limited chip 
is wasteful because some of its die will be empty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Under such conditions, it 
is very compelling to throw more cache onto the die, or, better yet, install 
another core for on chip SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing), as discussed above.&nbsp; 
AMD’s chips are evolving brilliantly towards this goal.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font size="5" color="#ffff00"><font face="Arial">Hyper-Threading</font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intel, too, recognizes the 
benefits of exploiting thread level parallelism.&nbsp; However, at least in its 
initial steps towards achieving this in upcoming P4 Xeon chips, Intel is taking 
a much different approach.&nbsp; The Santa Clara chipmaker has developed an interface 
to its P4 that makes it appear to be two processors to the OS, but it is not.&nbsp; 
Instead, it distributes the workload from multiple threads across existing 
Pentium 4 execution units ensuring greater processing efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intel claims up to a </span>
<a href="http://developer.intel.com/technology/hyperthread/">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif">40% gain</font></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in performance from Hyperthreading.&nbsp; 
Although 40% will be the exception rather than the rule, Hyper-Threading is a laudable 
accomplishment, but it is not without its shortcomings.&nbsp; As we have already 
mentioned, thermal constraints will likely prevent the Pentium 4 from reaching 
its deep pipeline’s potential.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hyperthreading might serve to largely negate 
Intel’s clock gating measures and significantly lower the chip’s thermally 
induced clock speed ceiling. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Needless to say, the 
Pentium 4’s large die size is less friendly to multi-core designs than the much 
smaller AMD designs.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">A 
Painful Northwood Transition</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And although the Santa 
Clara chipmaker would like investors to believe otherwise right now, the 
Northwood shrink does not immediately translate into lower costs and higher 
profits for Intel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Typically, moving to a new 
process is difficult and initial yields are low.&nbsp; Not only must the processor’s 
architecture be tweaked, but the fab’s “recipe” for producing the chip will be 
completely different from its predecessor’s.&nbsp; Many process variables need to be 
refined through an iterative process to maximize yields and this can be a 
lengthy and frustrating affair.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This very issue has been 
demonstrated publicly in the last few months as both MPU-maker Transmeta and 
graphics controller giant NVIDIA have fought capricious leprechauns in migrating 
to TSMC’s 0.13-micron copper process.&nbsp; Both companies have seen repeated delays 
in their next generation products with fingers being pointed in all directions 
by every involved party.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Intel is not just moving to 
0.13-microns, but is now adopting copper, a technology that AMD mastered years 
ago.&nbsp; Although the chip goliath has had its toes in the new process since the 
introduction of the PIII Tualatin, a major wrench was thrown in the works when 
crucial SVG 193-nanometer lithography tools, needed to retrofit existing Intel 
equipment for 0.13-microns, was a complete no show.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Without the Silicon Valley 
Group’s tools, Intel has been forced to scramble for an alternative approach, 
namely hard phase shift masks.&nbsp; This technology is </span>
<a href="http://www.siliconstrategies.com/manufacturing/facilities/OEG20010718S0047">
<font face="Arial, sans-serif">reportedly</font></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> more expensive, and the unexpected direction change will likely 
extend process qualification times.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bert McComas, Principal 
Analyst of <a href="http://www.inqst.com/">Inquest Mark</a></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="http://www.inqst.com/">et Research</a>, codified Intel’s problems when we spoke with him recently:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Has Intel put enough capacity in place using the 
old tools, or did they hold back waiting for the real thing? &nbsp;They may have only 
planned enough capacity in dual phase to satisfy Tualatin demand for servers and 
notebooks. &nbsp;If capacity is a problem, can they ramp up quickly with more dual 
phase capacity...&nbsp; Also, could we expect a shortage of Tualatins as Northwood 
ramps? &nbsp;This would translate into a boost for AMD and VIA if the market can 
anticipate and prepare to react by putting the right platforms in place for 
notebooks and servers.</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Northwood was originally 
expected to launch last October, but Intel had to postpone the chip until 
today.&nbsp; </span>

<font face="Arial, sans-serif">Reported</font></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Northwood shortages appear to confirm suspicions that this delay
