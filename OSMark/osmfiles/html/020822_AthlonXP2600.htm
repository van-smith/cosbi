<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="5">At this moment we will pause</font><span style="font-family: Arial;"> 
from the long march through our benchmark results to revisit the significant 
issues regarding BAPCo's SysMark 2002 brought up by AMD during our recent 
meeting with representatives from that chipmaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Click
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/reviews/2002/08/020821_AthlonXP2600/020821_AthlonXP2600.htm">here</a> 
to read the first part of our Athlon XP 2600+ review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We must state up front that despite the 
condemning information divulged to us, the AMD spokesmen repeatedly expressed 
support and guarded optimism for the reformation of BAPCo.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Background</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For several years we have 
been on a campaign to educate reviewers and readers of the
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/articles/2001/august/010814_Intel_SysMark/010814_Intel_SysMark.htm">
link</a> between Intel and BAPCo, the parent organization of the SysMark family 
of commercial benchmarks.&nbsp; Inside the computer industry, the connection 
between the chipmaker and the benchmark developer is commonly acknowledged.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If fact, the head of a 
competing benchmark firm bluntly labeled BAPCo as a "front" for Intel.&nbsp; 
Randall Kenney, the head of CSA Research, made this statement during his 
presentation at Platform Conference in early 2001.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/mail.jpg" width="536" height="198"><br>
<i>BAPCo's links to Intel were at one time more visible.&nbsp; This BAPCo 
product was sent from Intel's internal post office.</i></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Confirmation</font></p>
 
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">As we reported in
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/reviews/2002/08/020821_AthlonXP2600/020821_AthlonXP2600.htm">Part 1</a> of this 
review, AMD confirmed to us that it has joined BAPCo as a full member.&nbsp; The 
chipmaker undertook this surprising move with the hope that it might be able to 
help "correct" a benchmark that it currently characterizes as "broken."</span></p>
 
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We discovered that Intel chairs 
the BAPCo desktop performance committee which is the body that is responsible 
for SysMark.&nbsp; This is not much of a surprise.&nbsp; </span></p>
 
<p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Much more importantly, AMD 
reluctantly admitted that due to BAPCo's nature as primarily a meeting 
facilitator, Intel itself has been providing software engineers for the 
development of the SysMark products.&nbsp; When pressed further, the AMD 
representative admitted that it is likely that <i>all</i> SysMark development so 
far has been conducted internally at Intel by Intel.</span></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Method</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">We have 
lambasted the SysMark products for their unrealistic workloads, but their 
scoring methods are equally atrocious.&nbsp; Instead of scoring each task on its 
own and weighting them according to usage model criteria, an individual task's 
importance depends on how long it takes to complete!&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">That's right, a 
task's contribution to the final SysMark2002 score is entirely derived by how 
long it takes to execute!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For example, a 3d 
rendering test that might take one second to complete would only contribute one 
tenth as much to the final SysMark score as a ten-second task that consists of 
loading an application.&nbsp; Moreover, tasks are often repeated many times in 
SysMark, skewing a particular workload even more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">Why implement 
such a bizarre scoring scheme?&nbsp; Because it naturally biases the entire 
benchmark towards large working sets...</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">...w</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">hich 
demand memory throughput</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">...</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">which 
is one of the Pentium 4's few strengths.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And it also allows 
particular tasks to be weighted more heavily through repetition.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is not merely a bad 
scoring strategy, it is intrinsically biased.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/method.gif" width="542" height="313"><br>
<i>AMD's example illustrating SysMark's scoring method.</i></p>
  
<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman"> <span class="home">
===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Evidence</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">SysMark 2001 and 2002 
obfuscate their specific tasks by spitting out one "dumb" number as a score for 
an entire suite of tests.&nbsp; This makes it impossible to know the relative 
performance of CPUs on individual tasks.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Even so, it is possible 
from mere observations to notice some of the strange workloads deployed in the 
BAPCo tests.&nbsp; For instance, we have cited the Excel test, which is composed 
almost entirely of repeated sorts over large datasets, as an example of an 
obviously unrealistic workload.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, AMD has been able 
to "pick the lock" on SysMark to gain a much keener understanding into the 
internal workings of these tests.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Athlon XP was 
introduced after SysMark 2001 was released, but before SysMark 2002 became 
available.&nbsp; AMD knew  that the Athlon XP 
performed much worse compared to the P4 on SysMark 2002 than on SysMark 2001 
(especially after the Windows Media Encoder
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/reviews/2002/01/020107_AthlonXP2000_2/020107_AthlonXP2000_2.htm">
patch</a> is applied so that the program properly recognizes SSE in the Athlon 
XP).&nbsp;  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Trying to 
understand why this scoring discrepancy existed, the chipmaker discovered that when comparing SysMark 2001 to SysMark 
2002 the following patterns were evident:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tasks were removed that 
favored AMD.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tasks were added that 
favor Intel.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Workloads that favored 
Intel were repeated -- sometimes many times -- to inflate their weight under the 
scoring scheme described above.</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">An example of this is the Adobe 
PhotoShop component of SysMark.&nbsp; In the 2001 version of the BAPCo/Intel 
product, 13 different filters were used.&nbsp; On <b>eight</b> of these 13 
filters the Athlon XP 2000+ beat the 2GHz Northwood P4.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">However, in SysMark 2002 <b>every single 
one</b> of these eight filters where removed -- again, tasks where the Athlon XP 
beat the Pentium 4 -- and were replaced with <b>repeated</b> filters that the 
Pentium 4 executed faster than the Athlon XP.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/photoshop.gif" width="712" height="412"><br>
<i>The Athlon XP won all of the Photoshop filters marked in green.&nbsp; None of 
these are in SysMark2002.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Another indefensible example of biasing 
SysMark 2002 involved the "Flash" tests.&nbsp; Originally, 211 of the 241 Flash 
tasks were "Step Frame" in SysMark 2001.&nbsp; The Athlon XP, which was 
introduced after SysMark 2001 was released, excels at "Step Frame" operations.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Remarkably, in SysMark 2002 there are 
now <b>zero</b> "Step Frame" Flash tasks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">That's right, <b>88%</b> of the original 
Flash test tasks -- again, operations that the Athlon XP performed well -- was 
completely yanked out of SysMark 2002.&nbsp; Additionally, the Flash test file 
exploded in size from 118kB to 2.662MB thus stressing bandwidth and biasing this 
task by consuming much more time. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/Flash.gif" width="684" height="387"><br>
<i>The Flash component of SysMark was eviscerated only to be stuffed with 
P4-friendly fat for 2002.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">In Access, 
the Athlon XP beat the Pentium 4 almost everywhere in SysMark 2001 (on our
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/news/news.htm">front page</a> yesterday, we published 
results where a modest 1GHz VIA C3 trounced a 1.7GHz P4-Celeron in another 
database test -- "NetBurst" is "NetBust" when it comes to databases).&nbsp; For 
the 2002 version of the BAPCo/Intel benchmark suite, the Access test was almost 
completely removed!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/Access.gif" width="644" height="402"><br>
<i>The Pentium 4 couldn't win in Microsoft Access so the test was almost 
eliminated for 2002.</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: white;">AMD even 
touched upon the Excel component of SysMark which we have criticized in the past for its grossly distorted workload.&nbsp; 
The number two CPU producer quantified Excel's workload by discovering that 
sorting, a bandwidth intensive operation that is an atypical task in Excel, 
accounted for <b>over 90%</b> of the Excel application time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In other words, over 90% 
of the Excel score in SysMark 2002 is determined by sort speed when sorting is 
not even common when using Excel!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="020822_AthlonXP2600_files/sort.gif" width="678" height="445"><br>
<i>Sorting accounts for a whopping 90% of the Excel score in the latest SysMark 
test!</i></p>

===================================</span></font></p>
 
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Lawsuit</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As we have reported 
recently, a <a href="http://www.carrkorein.com/">group</a> of Pentium 4 owners has lodged a class action lawsuit against 
Intel.&nbsp; This group of disgruntled Intel customers charge the chipmaker with 
misrepresenting the true performance of the Pentium 4 in comparison with the 
Pentium III and Athlon processors.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">AMD's discoveries covered 
here offer potent ammunition for conviction since the data bluntly shows that 
Intel's actions to mislead customers were calculated and deliberate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">To gain credibility for 
its covertly developed marketing tools, Intel created BAPCo as a front 
organization to distribute SysMark as an independently derived benchmark suite.&nbsp; 
However, Intel itself produced the tests, while safely shielding itself from 
suspicion (other than ours) behind BAPCo.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We write many of our own 
tools.&nbsp; As we have reported often before, it is actually very difficult to 
construct a set of balanced benchmarks that favor the Pentium 4 over the Athlon 
XP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">AMD's evidence shows clearly that after 
setting up BAPCo Intel then went far, far out of the way to skew SysMark -- 
perhaps the most widely used benchmark suite today -- to favor the Pentium 4 
over competing CPU architectures.</span></p>
