<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Opening Xbox</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The Microsoft Xbox is about the size of a small VCR 
and has a good, solid feel.&nbsp; The case is attractive.&nbsp; The bundled 
controller is considerably larger than those that come with other consoles and 
everyone we spoke with agreed that the Xbox controller is more comfortable to 
use than most rival products.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The Xbox controller has a relatively powerful 
force feedback mechanism.&nbsp; Once, while taking a break from a game, a 
controller vibrated off the table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Before we give instructions on how to
open the Xbox, understand that disassembling your console will void
your warranty and expose the delicate internal components of your
system to potential damage.&nbsp;
<i>VHJ</i> recommends strongly against opening your Xbox and cannot be 
held responsible for any damages that may occur if you stubbornly choose to do 
so anyway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The first step to taking apart the Xbox is 
flipping it over and peeling off the rubber feet to expose the torque screw holes.&nbsp; 
Yes, nearly all of the screws used in the Xbox are the dreaded torque screws, so 
you'll need an appropriate set of drivers.&nbsp; The mounting holes are 
illustrated below.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/ScrewHoles.jpg" width="520" height="390"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">In addition to the mounting holes under the 
rubber feet, Microsoft hid two other holes under tamper-proof stickers as shown 
above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">After extracting the torque screws, flip over 
the console and carefully remove the top cover.&nbsp; The insides of the Xbox 
are 
robustly shielded with sharp metal so it is possible to cut yourself if you are 
not careful.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/TopCover_Screws.jpg" width="469" height="408"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">You can see the giant torque screws 
immediately below the cover.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We were simultaneously struck with both how 
full the Xbox was and how much it looked like a PC.&nbsp; Here is a picture of 
the Xbox with the top cover removed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/InsideXbox.jpg" width="533" height="427"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">It is hard to see from this picture, but both 
the hard drive and the 5X DVD-ROM drive share the same IDE channel. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">
<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">The Drives</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">At first glance, the drives inside the Xbox 
look like normal PC components but there are subtle differences.&nbsp; The 5X 
DVD-ROM drive has a proprietary connector that bundles power [<i>ed: typo, not 
data</i>] and audio out 
into a single cable.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/DVD_Connect.jpg" width="480" height="205"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">From all appearances, the hard drive is a 
standard Seagate model, but read on...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/hd2.jpg" width="381" height="459"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We pulled out the drive and connected it to a 
PC to attempt to read its contents.&nbsp; Win98 saw the drive, but reported that 
it was not partitioned.&nbsp; Win2k could see the drive in Device Manager, but 
could not see it in Drive Manager so the drive could not be mounted.&nbsp; Linux 
would either lock-up or report an error when attempting to read the partition 
table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Our experience suggests that Microsoft is 
using a standard IDE drive, but that it is has  proprietary flash ROM firmware that 
sends back erroneous data when the partition table is scanned. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Although the Xbox's hard drive was expected to 
be 8GB, Win2k reported it as 10GB in size (the Xbox's OS does not reveal the amount 
of space on the drive).&nbsp; The drive also appears to be ATA100 compliant 
although it will not operate as such since it shares a 40-wire cable with the 
DVD-ROM drive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Interestingly, the Seagate hard drive is set 
up as "Cable Select" instead of "Master" on the IDE channel it 
cohabits with the 
DVD-ROM drive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We tried to upgrade the hard drive, but the 
Xbox gagged on it, telling us that our console needed service.&nbsp; Considering 
that the bundled drive appears to have proprietary firmware, it may not be 
possible for end user hard drive upgrades that use conventional PC hard drives.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">
<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">The Guts</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">After removing both drives along with their 
rigid plastic mounting frames, we could see the motherboard and power supply.&nbsp; 
In the photo below, the large passive heat sink covers the Intel processor.&nbsp; 
The smaller heat sink and fan cool the nVidia GPU.&nbsp; The IDE cable 
connecting the drives is attached to the lone IDE connector.&nbsp; The 
motherboard itself is very small -- about seven or eight inches square.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The power supply does not have a cover of its 
own so it is important to make sure the power cord is not connected.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/xboxguts.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">We thought it was interesting that the word 
"Microsoft" was silk-screened on the motherboard.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/Microsoft.jpg" width="301" height="304"></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">What makes the Xbox special is the nVidia 
chipset.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/Chipset.jpg" width="443" height="450"></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If you look closely in the photo above, you 
can see the 800 MB/s HyperTransport traces connecting the GPU (under the heat 
sink) and the MCP (the small chip in the lower left bearing nVidia's logo).</font></p>

  The silkscreening on the memory was very light and difficult to read.&nbsp; 
  Although Micron had been publicly tapped as a source for Xbox memory, we 
  reexamined the chips in our Xbox carefully and the memory it contained is 
  actually from Samsung.&nbsp; The chips have the markings "Samsung 136, 
  K4D263238M-QC50"</font></div>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Looking at the 64 MB of Samsung [<i>ed: not 
Micron</i>] DDR SDRAM (composed of four chips -- two on each channel and two on 
each side of the motherboard), we initially thought there were unpopulated pads for doubling the Xbox's memory, 
but there are actually two more chips on the reverse side of the motherboard </font>

<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">The CPU</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The large, passive CPU heat sink ventilated 
directly by the system fan is easy to remove by flipping the tension lever and 
stretching the base free from the mount.&nbsp; In the picture below, you can see 
the CPU and GPU located very close together.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/NB_CPU.jpg" width="502" height="328"></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">For many months, the official data on the Xbox 
website only stated that its CPU would be a 733 MHz Intel part.&nbsp; As we can 
see in the photo below, it appears that the CPU is simply a 733 MHz BGA Mobile 
Celeron mounted directly to the motherboard.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/CPU.jpg" width="302" height="268"></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Although the chip is outwardly a 0.18 micron 
Coppermine Mobile Celeron, it is unclear what FSB (Front-Side Bus: the chip 
talks to the outside world through this) speed the chip operates at.&nbsp; We 
had been told informally by Intel months ago that the FSB speed would be 133 MHz 
-- which would make this chip a mutant Celeron.&nbsp; Since 733 MHz&nbsp; a 
multiple of 133 MHz, the clock speed suggests that the part might be running at 
133 MHz (although 66 MHz is a possibility, we doubt that Microsoft would have 
accepted such a severe and artificial limitation that would greatly undermine 
gaming performance -- especially considering that the much more powerful AMD 
Duron with a 200 MHz FSB was passed over at the last moment for this chip).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">A very interesting CPU to consider for game 
consoles is the soon-to-be-released
<a href="http://www.vanshardware.com/news/2001/october/011016_VIA_MPF/011016_VIA_MPF.htm">VIA 
C5X</a>.&nbsp; Not only does this chip consume little power making cooling 
solutions cheap and compact, but its two double-pumped SSE units will likely 
make it a very strong gaming chip.&nbsp; The FPU has also been completely 
redesigned greatly improving upon the C3's decidedly weak floating point 
performance.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#008000" face="Times New Roman">
<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Overclocking</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">There doesn't appear to be any way to easily 
overclock the Xbox.&nbsp; Those few souls bound and determined to do so can find 
one certain route by removing the clock crystal and supplying an external clock 
signal.&nbsp; Be aware that every aspect of the machine will be sped up as well, 
meaning that game play will also be faster -- perhaps too fast if the 
adjustments are not made carefully.&nbsp; Also, since the entire system would be 
overclocked, headroom is not likely to be great.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="011116_Xbox_files/ClockCrystal.jpg" width="415" height="514"><br>
<i>There's the clock crystal -- have at it.</i></p>

<span class="home">===================================</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#ffff00">Quick Observations</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Having looked inside the Xbox, it is clear 
hardware-wise that Xbox buyers are getting a lot for their money.&nbsp; The Xbox 
is not only state-of-the-art, but it is also feature packed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">The Xbox gaming experience itself is 
unmatched.&nbsp; The graphics details of offerings like "Dead or Alive 3" or 
"Halo" exceed that of any other console.&nbsp; Gameplay is fluid and seamless 
and matches arcade level -- if not better than most arcade machines.&nbsp; The 
system is stable -- we have not experienced any glitches despite our 
mistreatment of our unit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">It is resoundingly clear that Microsoft has 
delivered <b>the</b> hardware.&nbsp; The Xbox can do what any other console can 
do and then some.&nbsp; The only question that remains is the software, and from 
what we have seen, this is not going to be an issue either.&nbsp; Not only is 
Microsoft <b>the</b> titan of software, it also has almost limitless wealth to 
ensure the Xbox succeeds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Gaming is an increasingly lucrative business 
that is soon to exceed motion pictures in terms of sheer dollars. The Xbox is a 
key strategy for Microsoft to help the Redmondian giantess intrude itself into 
the living rooms of everyone, helping Microsoft become the central hub for all 
things digital.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">Microsoft has great motivation to make the 
Xbox succeed.&nbsp; The Xbox hardware is peerless.&nbsp; The fortunes behind the 
gaming console are almost limitless.&nbsp; The games already look and play 
great.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, sans-serif">There are few sure bets in today's economy, 
but the Xbox looks like it might be one of them.</font></p>
